**NoC Routing Optimization:** Researched in Network-on-Chip (NoC) routing optimization by training DQN model, to tackle the routing problem within NoC Topologies, laying the foundation for future research in this domain.

**Model Development:** Employed ML tools like Keras and TensorFlow to create a Multi-layer Perceptron, enhancing NoC routing efficiency.

**Performance Metrics:** Evaluated models using key metrics (mean reward, packet delay, throughput), driving significant NoC routing improvements.
